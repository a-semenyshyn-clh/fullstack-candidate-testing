## About Test Job

Before the test job, I was not aware about the **Next.js** and **TailwindCSS**. I have go through these frameworks and I understand that the Next.js is used for server side rendering. In this job, I have configured the Next.js but as I am new to Next.js, I haven't used server side rendering for now, due to the time constraint. But surely, if I get chance, I can work on it without any issue. I have configured and implement **TailwindCSS** as well in this short time span. Although, I have implemented all the functionality and tried to complete all the designs but there can be some issues in design due to the time constraints.

## Project Structure

The project folder contains 2 sub folders i.e. **Backend** & **Frontend**. The Backend folder contains the code of the node server and the Frontend folder contains the code related to React application.

## Backend

This folder contains the code of the node server to serve the Rest APIs. For every filter and job related data, I have written RestAPI and pass only data that is required to display to simulate the production environment.

## Run Backend Server

1. cd `project/Backend`
2. run `npm install && npm run forever`
3. Backend server will run on port 3008

## Frontend

This folder contains the code of the react application. It will fetch the data from the Backend using RestAPI and render the UI.

## Run Frontend Server

1. cd `project/Frontend`
2. run `npm install && npm run forever`
3. Frontend server will run on port 3007
